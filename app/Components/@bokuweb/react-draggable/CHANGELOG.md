# Changelog

### 1.1.3 (Nov 25, 2015)

- Bugfix: Server-side rendering with react-rails, which does bad things like mock `window`

### 1.1.2 (Nov 23, 2015)

- Bugfix: `<Draggable>` was calling back with clientX/Y, not offsetX/Y as it did pre-1.0. This unintended
  behavior has been fixed and a test has been added.

### 1.1.1 (Nov 14, 2015)

- Bugfix: Clean up scroll events if a component is unmounted before drag stops.
- Bugfix: `NaN` was returning from scroll events due to event structure change.
- Add scroll drag modulation test.

### 1.1.0 (Nov 14, 2015)

- Move `grid` into `<DraggableCore>` directly. It will continue to work on `<Draggable>`.
- Development fixes.

### 1.0.2 (Nov 7, 2015)

- Fix `enableUserSelectHack` not properly disabling.
- Fix a crash when the user scrolls the page with a Draggable active.

### 1.0.1 (Oct 28, 2015)

- Fix missing dist files for webpack.
- Ignore non-primary clicks. Added `allowAnyClick` option to allow other click types.

### 1.0.0 (Oct 27, 2015)

- Breaking: Removed `resetState()` instance method
- Breaking: Removed `moveOnStartChange` prop
- Breaking: React `0.14` support only.
- Refactored project.
- Module now exports a `<DraggableCore>` element upon which `<Draggable>` is based.
  This module is useful for building libraries and is completely stateless.

### 0.8.5 (Oct 20, 2015)

- Bugfix: isElementSVG no longer can be overwritten by getInitialState (#83)
- Bugfix: Fix for element prefixes in JSDOM

### 0.8.4 (Oct 15, 2015)

- Bugfix: SVG elements now properly use `transform` attribute instead of `style`. Thanks @martinRoss

### 0.8.3 (Oct 12, 2015)

- Bugfix: Short-circuiting drag throws due to `e.changedTouches` check.

### 0.8.2 (Sep 21, 2015)

- Handle scrolling while dragging. (#60)
- Add multi-touch support. (#68)
- IE fixes.
- Documentation updates. (#77)

### 0.8.1 (June 3, 2015)

- Add `resetState()` instance method for use by parents. See README ("State Problems?").

### 0.8.0 (May 19, 2015)

- Touch/mouse events rework. Fixes #51, #37, and #43, as well as IE11 support.
- Moved mousemove/mouseup and touch event handlers to document from window. Fixes IE9/10 support.
  IE8 is still not supported, as it is not supported by React.

### 0.7.4 (May 18, 2015)

- Fix a bug where a quick drag out of bounds to `0,0` would cause the element to remain in an inaccurate position,
  because the translation was removed from the CSS. See #55.

### 0.7.3 (May 13, 2015)

- Removed a `moveOnStartChange` optimization that was causing problems when attempting to move a `<Draggable>` back
  to its initial position. See https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout/issues/56

### 0.7.2 (May 8, 2015)

- Added `moveOnStartChange` property. See README.

### 0.7.1 (May 7, 2015)

- The `start` param is back. Pass `{x: Number, y: Number}` to kickoff the CSS transform. Useful in certain
  cases for simpler callback math (so you don't have to know its existing relative position and add it to
  the dragged position). Fixes #52.

### 0.7.0 (May 7, 2015)

- Breaking change: `bounds` with coordinates was confusing because it was using the item's width/height,
  which was not intuitive. When providing coordinates, `bounds` now simply restricts movement in each
  direction by that many pixels.

### 0.6.0 (May 2, 2015)

- Breaking change: Cancel dragging when onDrag or onStart handlers return an explicit `false`.
- Fix sluggish movement when `grid` option was active.
- Example updates.
- Move `user-select:none` hack to document.body for better highlight prevention.
- Add `bounds` option to restrict dragging within parent or within coordinates.

### 0.5.0 (May 2, 2015)

- Remove browserify browser config, reactify, and jsx pragma. Fixes #38
- Use React.cloneElement instead of addons cloneWithProps (requires React 0.13)
- Move to CSS transforms. Simplifies implementation and fixes #48, #34, #31.
- Fixup linting and space/tab errors. Fixes #46.

### 0.4.3 (Apr 30, 2015)

- Fix React.addons error caused by faulty test.

### 0.4.2 (Apr 30, 2015)

- Add `"browser"` config to package.json for browserify imports (fix #45).
- Remove unnecessary `emptyFunction` and `React.addons.classSet` imports.

### 0.4.1 (Apr 30, 2015)

- Remove react/addons dependency (now depending on `react` directly).
- Add MIT License file.
- Fix an issue where browser may be detected as touch-enabled but touch event isn't thrown.
