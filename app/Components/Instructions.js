      <h4>Definition of a Sleep Spindle:</h4>
      <p className='std-para'>
        For the purpose of this study, we are defining a sleep spindle based on five important characteristics:
        <br/></p>
        <ol className='std-para'>
          <li>Shape </li>
          <li>Speed (frequency of oscillation) </li>
          <li>Duration </li>
          <li>Height </li>
        </ol>
      <p className='std-para'>
        Most importantly, the combination of these characteristics should make the spindle very distinct from
        its surroundings.

    </div>)
  },

  page4: function(){
    return (<div>
      <h4>1. Shape of spindles</h4>
      <p className='std-para'>
        The spindle is usually shaped like a diamond or football (this is sometimes referred to as a 'waxing/waning'
        shape). Note that sleep spindles are often found near K-complexes (see Figure 1). Sometimes the K-complex
        wave might be so close to the spindle that it changes the shape of the sleep spindle. A certain amount of
        deformation in the shape of sleep spindle (ie the axis of spindle is not completely flat) is ok (Figure 2).
      </p>
      <img src="img/instruction/page3.png" alt="Shape of spindle example"></img>

        <b>Figure 2:</b> Shape of the spindle (underlined in red) is acceptable in the first three examples, but not the
        fourth or fifth. Note that the third spindle shape is changed slightly because of other waves.

      <h4>2. Speed of spindles</h4>
      <p className='std-para'>
        A sleep spindle is a group of waves that oscillate (go up and down) at approximately 11-16 cycles per second
        (11-16Hz), or most commonly between 12-14. It can be difficult to estimate their speed.
        However, because the vertical dashed lines in the display mark 0.5 second intervals,
        one way to determine the speed is to count the number of wave peaks between the dashed lines:
        between 6 and 7 wave peaks in 0.5 seconds would be equal to 12-14 cycles per second (Figure 3). It is
        important that the spindle appears as a 'burst'; of waves that are slightly faster (closer together) than the waves
        around it (Figure 4).
      </p>
      <img src="img/instruction/page4a.png" alt="speed of spindle waves explanation"></img>
      <p className='std-para'>
        <b>Figure 3:</b> Estimating the speed of the spindle by counting the number of waves. In this enlarged
        picture, it is easy to see there are between 6 and 7 waves in 0.5 seconds, which is equal to 13 cycles per
        seconds. This is within the 12-14 cycle per second range of sleep spindles.
      </p>
      <img src="img/instruction/page4b.png" alt="speed of spindle waves examples"></img>
      <p className='std-para'>
        <b>Figure 4:</b> The first two examples are appropriate speeds for a sleep spindle. The third example is too
        slow, and the fourth example too fast (too many cycles per second) to be a sleep spindle. Notice that
        you can clearly see gaps between the waves in the third example, and you can see no gaps at all
        between the waves in the fourth example.

      <h4>Duration of spindle:</h4>
      <p className='std-para'>
        Most commonly, spindles are around 0.5 to 1.0 seconds in length (duration), but can be as short as 0.4
        seconds and as long as 2.5 seconds (Figure 5).
      </p>

        <b>Figure 5:</b> Example spindles of different durations. The second example could be considered one single
        long spindle, but there are slow segments in the middle, and in this case, it has been considered three
        separate spindles of shorter duration. The duration of the third example is too short to be considered a
        spindle (&lt;0.4 seconds).

      <h4>Height of waves in spindle:</h4>
      <p className='std-para'>
        The height (amplitude) of the spindle is less important than the other criteria. The height of the waves in the
        spindle is usually a little larger than the waves around it.

      <h4>How to identify sleep spindles:</h4>
      <p className='std-para'>
          To draw a bounding box around the spindles, you need to left click and drag with the mouse around the
          spindle. A menu then appears where you can select how confident you are about the spindle identification:</p>
          <ul className='std-para'>
            <li><b>High:</b> &quot;I am sure that this is a sleep spindle. It meets all of the criteria of shape, speed, duration and
            height and is very distinct from the surrounding waves.&quot;</li>
            <li><b>Medium:</b> &quot;I would bet that this is a spindle, although I am not completely sure because one of the
            criteria is not quite right. There are some imperfections in the spindle, but I still think it is a sleep
            spindle.&quot;</li>
            <li><b>Low:</b> &quot;I think this could be a spindle, but I am not positive. Two or more of the criteria are not
            perfect. It would be best to have someone have a second look at this.&quot;</li>
          </ul>
      <p className='std-para'>
          You must assign a confidence score to each spindle identification.
          Accuracy is important, so be sure to size the bounding box so that it only includes the spindles, not
          surrounding EEG waves. <br/>You can resize and move the bounding box (Figure 6) by clicking in the middle or
          on the edges and dragging. You can change the spindle certainty, or delete the bounding box clicking on it.
          There may be multiple spindles, or none within a window (Figure 7). If there are no spindles in the window,
          indicate this by clicking the box marked &quot;No spindles in window&quot; found at the bottom of your screen before
          moving on to the next window. Note that you will not be able to draw any spindle markers if 'No spindle in window' is checked.
          <br/>If the spindle runs into the end or beginning of the window, just draw the bounding box right up to the edge
          of the window.
      </p>

        <b>Figure 6:</b> Use your mouse to draw a bounding box around the spindle. The size of the bounding box
        can be changed by clicking on the middle or on the edges of the box and dragging. In this case, the
        certainty of the spindle has been judged as &quot;High&quot;. *If the spindle runs into the end or beginning of
        the window, just draw the bounding box right up to the edge of the window.

        Remember, you need to select the spindles precisely. Do not include any noise around them. You will only
        get credit if you do a careful job in selecting the spindles. We will double check some of your jobs to
        make sure you select events that fulfill the criteria.
        <br/><br/>
        The goal is to very accurately identify the spindles. Try as best you can to identify where the spindle
        begins and ends. <b>Quality is more important that quantity.</b>
